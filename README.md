# MyCal
A web app for calculating daily intake

This was the first web application I ever created and allows users to calculate their recommended daily intake based on their age, gender,
height and weight. It takes the mentioned inputs and uses Mifflin-St Jeor's equation to calculate the recommended daily intake. Additionally,
user's can add food recipes to the website or view existing recipes.

The web application was created using ASP.Net MVC

Here are some screenshots of the application
